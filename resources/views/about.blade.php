                        <p> To assist and guide home buyers in their search and selection process, and most importantly reduce their costs by offering a rebate ideally ranging from 1.5% to 2% based on the home purchase price and commission offered by the sellers. To treat real estate buyers and sellers as clients, which is in contrast with the standard brokerage model where the agents are perceived as client of the brokerage, not the actual buyers and sellers. AyAMi’s goal is to reduce housing costs in local communities while providing first class premier services.” </p>
